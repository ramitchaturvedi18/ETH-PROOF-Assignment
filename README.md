# ETH-PROOF-Assignment
The purpose of the 'MyToken' smart contract is to show the features of a  cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum network. Users can keep track of balances, burn existing tokens, and mint new tokens.

# Description
A simple token named "Ramit Chaturvedi"—abbreviated "Ra_Ch"—is defined under the MyToken smart contract. The contract has features that allow tokens to be burned from any address, lowering the total supply, and minted new tokens to any address, increasing the total supply. The involved addresses' balances are updated by each token transaction and are kept in a publicly accessible mapping. This project is a great way to understand the fundamentals of token operations and smart contract development.
